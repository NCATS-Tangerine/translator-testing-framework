Feature: Check RTX responses
    This feature asks the RTX knowledge graph various questions and verifies that its answers include expected
    results. The tests query RTX using natural language questions, query graphs, or predefined query types.

    # NOTE: For tables, the 'name' column is always optional (it is ignored in the step implementations; it is simply
    # there for readability in this file)
